# Household Energy Prediction for Utility Load Forecasting

_Version 1.0_  
_Author(s): Jon Reifschneider, Duke University Pratt School of Engineering_

# Case Scenario
You are working as an analyst for the Canadian electic utility BC Hydro, which serves 1.8 million customers in British Columbia. You have been asked to work on the utility's load forecasting model for predicting future energy demand. Accurate demand prediction is critical for the utility to produce sufficient power to meet demand on a short-term and long-term basis.

The expansion of smart meter usage among many utilities has created increasing interest in machine learning models which predict energy demand at the individual home or building level, which can then be aggregated to a utility's entire territory. You have been asked to explore this approach using your organization's smart meter data. A review of advantages and limitations of different machine learning based approaches can be found <a href='https://www.informs-sim.org/wsc15papers/396.pdf'> here</a>.

In particular, you have been asked to better understand the relationship between changing weather conditions and the electric demand for a household. Your first objective is to examine the relationships between various weather parameters and electric consumption and determine which weather parameters most influence a home's energy usage. Once you have understood these relationships, you have been asked to evaluate different machine learning approaches to modeling a home's energy usage and report back to your team on what features are most valuable to use in prediction, which modeling approach(es) have shown most promise, and how well you are able to predict load at an individual home level.
